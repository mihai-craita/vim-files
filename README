VIM is an advanced text editor for UNIX systems.
You can get a Debian package of VIM compiled with support for scripting with Lua, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl but no GUI from: 

    http://packages.debian.org/testing/vim-nox

This repo contains my personal runtime configuration.

Installation:

   git clone https://github.com/mihai-craita/vim-files.git ~/.vim
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shougo/dein.vim/master/bin/installer.sh > installer.sh
   sh ./installer.sh ~/.vim/

Create symbolic links:

   ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
